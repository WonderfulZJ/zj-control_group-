You're free to pick your database and backend language, but we'd prefer if the entire stack is written in Typescript.

The raw data for restaurant opening hours is in `requirements.md` which you can ETL into your database.

Build a simple user-facing webapp that allows the user to filter for restaurants open by date time as well as restaurant name. On top of that, users can save restaurants into their own named collections (eg. Vegetarian favourites, Meat-lovers etc.).

No deployment is required.
